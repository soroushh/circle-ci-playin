    # Steps are a list of commands to run inside the docker container above.
    steps:
      - checkout # this pulls code down from GitHub
      - run: echo $CIRCLE_SHA1 # This prints "A first hello" to stdout.
      - run: echo "The above is the commit ID."
      - run: sleep 25 # a command telling the job to "sleep" for 25 seconds.
  two: # This is our second job.
    docker: # it runs inside a docker image, the same as above.
